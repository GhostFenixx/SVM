This is simple yet extensive Javascript code meant to be used in SPT Environment, best used in tandem with Greed.
Installation:
You have to prepare whole SPT setup, after that - throw whole repo folder into SPTFolder/user/mods.
After that it can be used, however by itself it won't do much, because it requires a set of data to work with that is being generated by Greed.
